During the second year of my degree (2015/16) I with a team had to create a project management software which displays WBT, PERT & Gantt Charts. We decided to do a web application.

I took on the back-end developing, the PHP & MySQL coding. As well as the AJAXing side of things within JavaScript also involved in getting data from and to our data library vis.js.

We only managed to develop the WBT chart where you can only add different tasks and rename a task.
